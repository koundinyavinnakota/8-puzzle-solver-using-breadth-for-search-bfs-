To run this package:
1) Git-clone the repository
2) Open terminal and run puzzle_solver.py file
 
In this package, Breadth first search algorithm is used to compute the path from the start node to the goal node.

Breadth first search (bfs):
It is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

Concepts used:
1.) OOPs
2.) Breadth first search alogorithm
3.) Backtracking algorithm
